Here is report for all three table.

The sample size is 250, the simulation time is 100. True beta is c(1.5,2,3,rep(0,5)), k for cross validation is 5.

We can see when we do our variavle selection at 2*rho level. Our method perform best. However, the rho in our method is also the biggest one. I think one reason is the pairwise likelihood method also introduce some noise in our dataset.
